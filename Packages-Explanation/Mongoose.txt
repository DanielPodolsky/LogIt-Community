Mongoose is a popular Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data and includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, and business logic hooks.
Key features of Mongoose include:

Schema definition with strong typing and validation rules
Middleware (pre/post hooks) for processing documents
Model-based operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents
Population for referencing documents across collections
Virtuals for computed document properties that aren't stored in MongoDB
Query building with chainable methods

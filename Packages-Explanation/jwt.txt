JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications.
Structure
A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots (.):

Header: Contains the token type and signing algorithm
Payload: Contains the claims (data)
Signature: Ensures the token hasn't been altered

Example: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
How JWTs Work

Authentication: User logs in, server verifies credentials and issues a signed JWT
Authorization: Client sends JWT with subsequent requests in the Authorization header
Verification: Server validates the token's signature and expiration time
